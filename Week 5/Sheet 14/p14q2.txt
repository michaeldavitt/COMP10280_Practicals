The recursive function gave an error once the number reached 995 ("maximum recursion depth exceeded
in comparison). This is to prevent stack overflow. When a program gets loaded into memory, there is a block of memory set aside to store variables from stack frames.
When too many stack frames are created, the number of variables stored in the stack section grows larger than what was allocated, resulting in stack overflow.

The non-recursive function was able to take larger inputs. 
Time taken when x = 10000: 0.1484520435333252 seconds
Time taken when x = 50000: 3.0707905292510986 seconds
Time taken when x = 100000: 19.672449588775635 seconds

The time taken increased as x increased. Note that there was no error when x went past 995
