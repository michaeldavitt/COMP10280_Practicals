A: When you write print(print_max()) instead of simply print_max(), you are attempting to print out the return value of the function print_max(), 
which is None because the function does not return a value

B: When you omit the brackets, the function call is not made. This is because when you type the function without the brackets, you are not making a function call, you are just
typing out the function object.

C: When you print the function object, it displays some information about the object. It displays the type (function), the name of the function, and the function's 
location in memory
