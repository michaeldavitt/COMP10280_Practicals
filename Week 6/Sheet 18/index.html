                    > My name is Michael Davitt. I have a <abbr title="Bachelor of Science">BSc</abbr> in Actuarial and Financial Studies, which I obtained in 2021 from <abbr title="University College Dublin">UCD</abbr>. My interests have shifted in recent months, and as a result I have decided to pursue an <abbr title="Master of Science">MSc</abbr> in Computer Science (Conversion).

                    > I believe that <abbr title="Information and Communications Technology">ICT</abbr> is <em>extremely</em> important in our lives, and that it will likely grow in importance as time goes on. The importance of <abbr title="Information and Communications Technology">ICT</abbr> in our lives was highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic, where applications like Zoom and Microsoft Teams enabled people to continue their work/studies whilst also adhering to public health guidelines.

                    > Technology is a <em>powerful</em> tool, using which we have accomplished great things. That being said, technology is only useful when there are people who know how to use it. I believe that, by studying Computer Science and entering into the field, I can help ensure that technology is used in a way that benefits society and makes the world a better place.
